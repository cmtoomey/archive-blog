## About

This is my personal, Tableau-centric blog. It won't be all Tableau, all the time - but that's where it all starts for me. **All words and opinions are my own, and do not reflect the positions of my employer or Tableau.** I'll do my best to provide citations and references as much as possible, so please feel free to call it out if you see it. All my contact information is at the bottom: email, facebook, twitter and github. Comments are enabled - please be nice.

This blog is produced using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and hosted via <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>. It's fast, free, and you can customize it however you like.

This blog's style, the {Personal Jekyll Theme}, was created by <a href="https://github.com/PanosSakkos">Panos Sakkos</a>. If you like it, you should give it Star or Fork it and make it your own!

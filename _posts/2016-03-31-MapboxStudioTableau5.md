Welcome to the fifth and final installment of the Ultimate Mapping Guide. [Craig Bloodworth](https://twitter.com/craigbloodworth) and I hope you have found it helpful and are now ready to show the world some amazing work! This installment will focus on everything that happens once you have made your awesome [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com) map and are ready to put it in production with Tableau. 

If you have a map, but want to take the design and styling to the next level, be sure to read Craig's [most recent post](http://www.theinformationlab.co.uk/2016/03/31/ultimate-mapping-guide-part-4-next-level-styles/) before continuing. 

Home stretch - here we go!!!

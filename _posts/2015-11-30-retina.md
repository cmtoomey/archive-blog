Have your ever fired up your fancy new MacBook or Surface to find that your custom Mapbox/ESRI/Stamen maps look fuzzy?

Blame Apple - they popularized the "Retina class" display.

Before you work up some fanboy rage, let me say that high-DPI displays are wonderful. They make images clearer, text more crisp than was ever possible before. Here's an example:

![Retina2](https://cmtoomey.github.io/img/displaypic-1448917886-41.jpg)

Look at the image on the left vs the right. The higher pixel count makes it easier to read and scale the image. That means at both large and small sizes, it will be beautiful. There is a price to this beauty, however. Now we expect every image and letter to be perfectly rendered. If something is even the least bit fuzzy, our first thought is either that the tool or the source is broken. And nobody wants a broken experience.

Not every display is high-DPI, and since that higher quality comes with a larger file size, the Internet has created a way to distinguish between high-DPI and regular images.

## @2x

These days, most images can be served @2x - meaning that if your display is fancy, so too will be your images and applications. Tableau is no different - at least on a Mac. PC’s are a bit more challenging - so before you read any further - please go [here and vote up this idea](https://community.tableau.com/ideas/4527) or give [this trick a shot](http://www.danantonielli.com/adobe-app-scaling-on-high-dpi-displays-fix/).

## Tableau @2x

Most of the time, all that matters is that the UI renders properly. However, what you may not know is that Tableau’s maps are images laid out on a coordinate system (not actually a map like Google or Bing Maps). This means that those tiles should be served @2x if supported, and served regularly if not. Tableau’s in-house maps do this - but what about your favorite external map company, [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/)?

### Not quite

If you follow [DataBlick’s wonderful tutorials on Mapbox integration]((http://datablick.com/2015/11/28/easy-peasy-lemon-squeezy-mapbox-maps-and-layers-in-tableau-9-2/)), you might end up with something like this:

![TMS1](https://cmtoomey.github.io/img/ss-1448919511-21.png)

Which renders this map:

![TMSMap1](https://cmtoomey.github.io/img/tableau-1448919153-93.png)

Let's compare that to the map that Mapbox natively serves up.

![Mapbox1](https://cmtoomey.github.io/img/mapbox-1448919188-94.png)

Mapbox is serving high DPI content - but Tableau can’t render it properly. Here’s the important piece of that request

![TMS2](https://cmtoomey.github.io/img/screenshot-1448919552-41.png)

That .png256 tells Mapbox what quality of tile to request. Of course, they have an @2x option.

![DisplayOptions](https://cmtoomey.github.io/img/screenshot-1448919643-18.png)

So let’s add @2x to our TMS. What happens? Here’s the TMS snippet

![TMS3](https://cmtoomey.github.io/img/screenshot-1448919885-9.png)

And here is the Tableau map

![TMSMap2](https://cmtoomey.github.io/img/screenshot-1448919928-80.png)

Still fuzzy - dang.

### Wait, 9.2 to the Rescue!!!

Here’s the exact same map in 9.2.

![92Map](https://cmtoomey.github.io/img/screenshot-1448920101-38.png)

What’s different?

# {D}

**Huh?** Let’s take a look under the hood. Export the TMS that Tableau created by going to Map > Background Maps > Map Services. Select a service and click “Export”

![TMSExport](https://cmtoomey.github.io/img/tmsexport-1448920318-22.gif)

Now let’s compare the DataBlick-style TMS to the Tableau 9.2-generated TMS.

![Compare](https://cmtoomey.github.io/img/screenshot-1448920680-78.png)

I’ve obscured the Access Token - but you’ll notice something new in the red boxes, just before the .png256: **{D}**. This is what let’s you tell Tableau to request High-DPI (**@2x**) tiles if your screen supports it.

Let’s change our 9.1 TMS to match this format and see how the map changes.

![Changes](https://cmtoomey.github.io/img/screenshot-1448920865-84.png)

### BOOM! Native Retina tiles in Tableau.

## Why should you care?

9.2 is here, but not everyone is going to update immediately. That doesn’t mean that people should have to suffer with low-quality maps, especially if they are going to take the time to build their own in Mapbox Studio.

Also, while Tableau is natively supporting Mapbox, there are other map providers that aren't natively supported. If you want to use ESRI or CartoDB, you shouldn't have to suffer with crappy tiles (if they don't support @2x, that's a different problem.)

So now you know - all you need is **{D}** and you’ll have perfectly rendered tiles all the time.

This is a quick post about creating the [Wheezey](https://public.tableau.com/profile/chris.toomey1132#!/vizhome/Wheezey/Dashboard1) viz. 

I don't keep track of my fitness data (I should, but I don't). My wife on the other hand, has used RunKeeper and her Garmin for YEARS. Two years ago she ran in the Lululemon Seawheeze half in Vancouver. I have to say that it is one of the most inspiring athletic events I have ever seen (and I didn't even run). Lulu does a great job making it all about the athletes - inspiring them to have fun and do their best.

So I wanted to try and catalog her journey. She's run more than just this one, but SeaWheeze is special. After the first one, she rounded up some of her best friends to go up with us this year to do it again.

So let's talk about design.

First off - I wanted to do Vancouver, B.C. justice. SeaWheeze isn't just a run, it's a celebration of the city. I quickly pulled together a map of the course, and highlighted the route. 

In keeping with the branding of the race, I wanted the city to LOOK like SeaWheeze. So I built a quick map in Mapbox Studio using colors inspired by that year's branding.

Lots of navy and gold, which you can see in the map. 

The next bit I wanted, to set the context, was I wanted the city to breathe. Why?

A core part of the run is take in everything Vancouver has to offer. So I added a little JS magic to make the route breathe (the duration of the animation is the length of an actual human breath). I'm hosting it via GitHub Pages, so it all works with Tableau Public.

Once I had that - I assembled all my data using the [Strava Data Connector](https://data.theinformationlab.co.uk/strava.html) from the Information Lab (h/t to Craig Bloodworth).

The next piece was back-and-forth about the story with my wife. It's her data, so she got editorial control over the content. 

As for formatting, I needed scrolling of indeterminate length, and as far as I know, containers don't give you this. I also I knew I was going to have to use Story Points as they were the best way to bucket the story into bite-sized chunks. 

BUT you can't put Story Points on a Dashboard. SO...I published the Story Points separately and then used the URL item in my Dashboard. That gave me full control over the formatting, interaction, and I could pull it all together the way I wanted it. 

I think the end result is pretty cool - and I got the thumbs up from my wife to publish it. I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed building it!

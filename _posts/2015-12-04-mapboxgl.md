In the previous post, I talked about how Tableau and Mapbox currently play together. I also showed you that is was possible to use the latest and greatest from Mapbox inside of Tableau.

What I didn’t show you was how to do it.

###This is how you do it

The first thing to remember that Tableau requires tiles in order to render a map.

![Tiles](https://cmtoomey.github.io/img/screenshot-1449245574-4.png)

So how do you get MapboxGL to give you tiles, when it renders everything on-the-fly (in your browser), with fractional zooming?

If you look at the [Mapbox Developers page](https://www.mapbox.com/developers/), the first Web Services API is Styles...and it contains the magic word.

![Tiles2](https://cmtoomey.github.io/img/screenshot-1449245878-78.png)

The Styles API gives programmatic access to your Studio Styles, which is cool by itself. What is even more interesting is that it appears it can give you tiles too. If you click in, you’ll see this list of things the Styles API does.

![List](https://cmtoomey.github.io/img/screenshot-1449246113-70.png)

Note that the word “tiles” doesn’t appear on that list. It used to have the following reference (Mapbox updates their documentation all the time, and this one got cut, for now):

**Request Static Images and Tiles from Style**
https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/username/mapid/tiles/{Z}/{X}/{Y}@2x?access_token=[access_token]

Like any good nerd, I snagged that URL and put it into [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/).

![postman](https://cmtoomey.github.io/img/screenshot-1449247370-60.png)

Always ask companies for what you want. Whether it’s Alpha access from Tableau, a trial from that fancy new DB company, or API access - **ALWAYS ASK FOR WHAT YOU WANT**. The worst they will say is no. Then ask on Twitter, then they will probably say yes.

So I asked my good friend Matt Irwin for access and he graciously agreed, provided I do the following. You need to pay attention here:

>##This is a internal, prerelease API. It is subject to change and your mileage may vary.

I'll talk about **Terms and Conditions** later.

Armed with access to the API, I fired the exact same call in Postman.

![200](https://cmtoomey.github.io/img/screenshot-1449248613-52.png)

It works! Postman should show you the tile, but pasting the URL into the search bar works just fine to verify.

So now all that is needed is to convert that URL into something Tableau can read in a TMS.

The URL format Tableau uses for Mapbox now looks like this:

*https://api.mapbox.com/v4/{L}/{Z}/{X}/{Y}{D}.png256?access_token=[access_token]*

{L} is the layer, {Z}/{X}/{Y} are the zoom, longitude, and latitude.

Here’s the GL Style Tile API again, with emphasis added

*https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/***username/mapid***/tiles/***{Z}/{X}/{Y}@2x***?access_token=[access_token]*

Here’s the Tableau-ized version

####https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/{L}/tiles/{Z}/{X}/{Y}{D}?access_token=[access_token]

###Lets make a TMS

Getting it into a 9.1 TMS is pretty easy. Here’s what it looks like, and here’s a [sample](https://github.com/cmtoomey/TableauGL). This will work pre-9.1 too!

![TMS](https://cmtoomey.github.io/img/screenshot-1449249240-61.png)

For 9.2 it’s a little trickier. Why? When you add a Mapbox map, Tableau is actually writing the map source directly into the Workbook XML. Add a regular Mapbox map to your workbook. Have no fear - you don’t need to go hacking it out of the XML. Tableau graciously included an Export button.

![92](https://cmtoomey.github.io/img/screenshot-1449249678-91.png)

I exported the TMS, and swapped out the relevant fields using the new URL. Here’s what it looks like and here’s a [sample](https://github.com/cmtoomey/TableauGL).

![TMS2](https://cmtoomey.github.io/img/screenshot-1449249829-18.png)

You can treat this TMS just like the one’s Anya has been blogging about. You can use one layer, multiple layers, whatever you want - all with the power of Mapbox Studio.

##Now for the not so fun part

####Terms and Conditions

What you need to know

+ You need a Mapbox Account (duh)
+ You need an Access Token with the appropriate scoping: styles:tiles.
+ You cannot use these maps behind a firewall or in a corporate environment, without a Premium account (Matt made me say that).
+ At present, this is an unsupported hack. Tableau may support Mapbox, but they don't support this...yet.
+ Access to this API is at Mapbox's discretion right now. You will be put into the queue and notified when the API becomes available. If Mapbox gives you access, remember this is an internal beta right now...so don't pester.
+ If you need help, please reach out to me and I'll do the best I can.

**How to get access**
If you want access to this API, send a request to [help@mapbox.com](mailto:help@mapbox.com). Indicate in that email that you are a Tableau user and want access to Mapbox GL in Tableau. You’ll be notified when the API is ready.

If you are antsy, send the request, send me a message and we’ll work something out for a short testing period.

Once the API goes public, you'll need to know how to create a scoped key. Let’s cover that now: Log into Mapbox, click Studio.

On the right where it says **Access Token** is a button that says “Manage.” Click that.

![Scoping](https://cmtoomey.github.io/img/screenshot-1449250627-78.png)

Then click the blue button that says “Create a new token.” Give your token a name and check the *styles: tiles scope*. Click Generate and then copy that somewhere safe - you’ll only see it once.

![scoping1](https://cmtoomey.github.io/img/screenshot-1449250867-76.png)

That’s it.

####Other things you need to know

Mapbox GL is a completely different technology than Mapbox JS. Read all about it [here](http://lyzidiamond.com/mapbox-studio-maptime/#0). Don’t expect to get 1:1 results out of the gate.

Why? This API is an interesting piece of technology: you send the request and there is a determination made as to whether or not the requestor supports GL rendering. If it does, you get the normal experience. If not, you get tiles.

This presents an interesting challenge for map design. Because of the order of rendering operations, certain aspects of the map might look a little funny. Labels might get clipped and there might be some inconsistencies in your base map. Part of that might also be Tableau using cached tiles. Here’s two examples.

The first is an instance of text being clipped along a tile border.

![Clipping](https://cmtoomey.github.io/img/screenshot-1449251636-45.png)

The second is an improperly rendered tile - see the lack of white borders in Kentucky.

![render](https://cmtoomey.github.io/img/screenshot-1449251672-81.png)

So here’s what’s coming next. I’m teaming up with Craig Bloodworth (the O.G. Mapboxer) to pull apart the rendering documentation and build some design guidelines for using Mapbox GL in Tableau. How to use the Mapbox tools, test your styles for Tableau, and all manner of tips and tricks. That’s coming soon.

There you have it - Mapbox GL in Tableau. Go forth and do big things!

Without further ado, here's my entry:

This is Polyntir (and I’ll tell you where that name comes from in a bit). Before I do that, I’m going to address a small legal matter: “Can you submit an Iron Viz entry like that?”

### **{TL:DR - Yes}**

Excerpt from the rules: “…produce and publish a Tableau Public data visualization, and provide the URL of the visualization to Sponsor at [https://public.tableau.com/s/wiki-data-submit](https://public.tableau.com/s/wiki-data-submit) (“Submission”).”

Underlying Viz is built in Tableau and can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/chris.toomey1132#!/vizhome/GDELT_0/UnclassifiedExplorer). The link to the core submission can be found at the top. **Produce and Publish a Tableau Public visualization and provide to [Tableau] - check.**  

## Let's talk details

#### What is it?
It’s a Tableau Dashboard, built as a modern web application.

#### Underlying data
[Global Database of Events, Languages, and Tone.](http://gdeltproject.org/) GDELT is kind enough to provide all their data, free of charge, via [Google BigQuery](http://gdeltproject.org/data.html#googlebigquery).

#### Underlying technology
Maps by [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/), Data Processing by [Alteryx](http://www.alteryx.com/), HTML/CSS with [Google Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/), Integration via [Tableau Javascript API.](http://onlinehelp.tableau.com/current/server/en-us/js_api.htm)

Where does the name come from? It’s a mash-up of Polymer and Palantir (those are the two logos used in the header). Why? I’m glad you asked!

I’ve been kicking around the idea of doing a Homeland-style, looking at worldwide activities related to the intelligence community. I knew that GDELT contains detailed data on topics, organizations, and people related to that topic, along with sentiment analysis and locations of people talking about it all…and it’s freely accessible.

I was talking about the idea with Allan Walker, and he suggested I go with a Spy vs. Spy theme: Black & White (Apparently he got the idea from Anya A’Hearn - Thanks Anya!!! Hopefully I did your idea justice); take polarizing content and abstract it into a binary set of themes, and see if you could detect trends, popularity, and relationships on a worldwide scale. And the good news - that’s just what GDELT does.

---
Having a base concept was good - but I needed some design inspiration. Trying to think like a producer on Homeland, I quickly realized that GDELT is really an open-source Signals Intelligence platform. Having spent some time with spooks and the tools they use, I then wondered if I could transform Tableau+GDELT into [Palantir](https://www.palantir.com/).

>*For those of you who haven't seen or heard of Palantir: They make two software platforms, [Gotham](https://www.palantir.com/palantir-gotham/) and [Metropolis](https://www.palantir.com/palantir-metropolis/), that are the gold standard in intelligence analysis. Metropolis is focused on quantitative analysis, while Gotham is focused on network analysis.*

After spending some time on Palantir's website, I had come up with a design framework based on Gotham. I needed to provide four different capabilities: geospatial and time intelligence, anomaly detection, thematic exploration, and asset identification (Translation: Where and when important things happened; what is actually important; what concepts are associated with those events; who is being discussed and how positive does the world feel about them.)

Since we are talking spies and intelligence analysis, I felt it wouldn't be enough to just have elements of a tool, I wanted it to actually look and feel like a tool someone would use to do classified work. I went digging into the internet and found a current US Classification Manual.

<p  style=" margin: 12px auto 6px auto; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,Sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; -x-system-font: none; display: block;">   <a title="View Intelligence Community Markings System: Manual and Register on Scribd" href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/223130300"  style="text-decoration: underline;" >Intelligence Community Markings System: Manual and Register</a></p><iframe class="scribd_iframe_embed" src="https://www.scribd.com/embeds/223130300/content?start_page=1&view_mode=scroll&show_recommendations=true" data-auto-height="false" data-aspect-ratio="undefined" scrolling="no" id="doc_39896" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe>

In that document is a slide that shows how marking works. Read it if you want (it's probably out of date now), but the important part is here.

![Marking](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-IatOVzg8NWw/USlirDEdl6I/AAAAAAAAAII/ekHvxXt19tA/s1600/classification-colors.jpg)

Orange is Top-Secret, so that's the color I'm going to use as the base color. It is going to need markings, which would appear on any document or tool processing that type of information. **SI** is for **SIGNALS INTELLIGENCE** and **NOFORN** is for **NO FOREIGN NATIONAL ACCESS.** The way it is marked is very similar to how it would appear in the real world. I then wanted to add a nod to Tableau and Palantir in the header.

The end result is a workbook that should look and feel like a tool that the IC would use in their daily lives, on top of data they would probably be using regularly.

---
Now I had a design and all the data to build it, I was faced with a dilemma. Can Tableau Desktop actually do this? More importantly, can it perform exactly the way I want it to? I wanted it to be a fluid experience: where you could start where you want, investigate how you want, see things in motion, and not have to worry about whether or not the UI “fits” on your device.

Tableau does many things well - Dashboard UI is not one of them. Yes, I could build out images for backgrounds, have a bunch of icons and text firing Actions to traverse up and down the dashboard, and hope that it responds well in a Server environment. Public/Server has a nasty habit of rendering differently from Desktop (and I’m not even talking about the Pages Shelf - can we please expose that in Server and/or the Javascript API already?).

>**HEY TABLEAU!!** *Server side caching on Public could use some work. When I deployed my JS for animation - after 20-30 “frames” the caching could barely handle a half-second refresh before lagging. Even after a page refresh, where those results should be stored in Redis. Response seems to be similar, and the lag point seems to be random…might be worth testing more, and seeing how it handles on Server.*

I’m not a fan of shoehorning capabilities if I don’t have to, and I simply didn’t have time to do all the little pixel shifts building a UI in Tableau would entail - and it still would be blocky and unpredictable.

So, I decided to build my own UI, knowing that I could have total control and complete execution of my concept. I decided to use Google’s new Polymer Library for the HTML/CSS - because it’s easy to use and really really cool (see below). That only left hosting.

AWS {**UPDATE: It's now hosted on GitHub Pages**} to the rescue. For those of you who don’t know, you get a free year of Amazon’s basic cloud services. What I didn’t know, and soon discovered, was that instead of deploying a random EC2 instance with Apache, copying things over, and dealing with all the Inbound/Outbound Firewall rules, I could simply create an S3 Bucket, make it a static web server with one click, and post my code there. That link is embedded above. {**UPDATE: There is even less configuration for GitHub Pages, I just created a branch off my source code and ta-da!**}

So Concept(check). Design(check). Infrastructure(check). Now on to the Data.

GDELT is massive, I used BigQuery to winnow the data down to the month of May (which was over 13M records). The data I needed was locked into columns that are internally delimited. Alteryx has a BigQuery connector, which I used to parse and unpivot those columns.
GDELT’s columns have an inconsistent number of terms in each of the columns-of-interest, so traditional Text-to-Columns wouldn’t work (which requires a set number of columns to output).

**Pro-Tip 1** Text-to-Columns can also output to Rows, effectively doing both a parse and an unpivot simultaneously. This increased my row count to 130M rows…so I needed to do more parsing.

I won’t bore you with the details, except to call out a few items of note. Here’s the final workflows.

![Workflow](https://cmtoomey.github.io/img/workflow-1434655326-11.png)

I only really cared about a core set of themes - so I used the Summarize tool’s Group By feature to output a list to Excel. I then hand-removed themes I wasn’t interested in and joined that full list back into the workflow. Countries were easy to extract, as there was a special character set I could use to filter things out.

People and organizations was a little tougher - GDELT does raw extraction of both of those data points, which means that there could be multiple spellings, capitalization combinations, etc.
I used the workflow below to parse out organizations of interest, using a keyword filter and Union.

![Union](https://cmtoomey.github.io/img/orgs-1434655351-83.png)

I then used [Chris Love’s Fuzzy Matching tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35aNGzJ5kYY) to clean up both columns and join it back in.

![Fuzzy](https://cmtoomey.github.io/img/findreplace-1434655357-83.png)

Finally, I filtered to the last four days of May - that was the largest number of days I could get without going over 10M records and built the dashboard.

Data set complete.

---
I’m going to leave the features of the dashboard to the end. Next up - the wrapper.

It’s all built using Google Polymer. What is Google Polymer? I'll let them tell you all about it - Don’t worry, I’ll wait.

<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fD2As5RmM8Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The short version is that it’s basically a way to template the web - build, skin, and share core components. It’s responsive by design, integrates with Google’s Material Design principles, and drastically simplifies the process of web design. All I had to do was pick the parts I needed - header, toolbar, cards and start nesting them together. To make them float, you need something like this.

    <stuff>
      <paper-material elevation="5">
        <YOURSTUFF></YOURSTUFF>
      </paper-material>
    </stuff>

Even better, because you get all the core HTML, styling and animation components out of the box, you can inspect the underlying code and demos, and just copy/paste their defaults into your project. It’s like a massive debugging tool at your fingertips - for someone who is constantly confused by CSS rules, it’s wonderful to see things in action and just apply those same principles to my own work.

Beyond ease of use - here’s why I chose Polymer. It assumes that certain aspects of the web should be a default: things like native responsiveness, data-binding, integration with Googles’s core services, e-commerce integration, offline, and push messaging should be deployable out of the gate.

What does that mean for Tableau? It means that you can drag and drop features into a website, set your viz size to Automatic, bootstrap it in, and it’s responsive. No jQuery, no media-queries, it just works. Look at my code, it’s all wiring.

Further more, you can drop in modern interfaces, and simply wire up event listeners. Radio buttons, toggles, animations, it’s all html tags and attributes. Data-bindings (meaning moving data and attributes from point A to B), is as simple as a new tag (is-auto-binding) and this: {{attribute}}.

You want to experiment - start here or here or here. The Designer will be updated to Polymer 1.0 soon, you can see all the 1.0 demos (and code) right now, and the videos are 10m or less.

---
Finally - to the dashboard. What can you do with it? Let’s do some analysis just like they would in the IC. The world is a pretty negative place - so let’s try and find the most positive people, places, and things being talked about and whether it’s normal or just an anomaly.

**First, find a hotspot**

You can see the good and bad bubble up over time.  It will pause when you hover, so you can snag points, and will resume when you mouse out. There’s something interesting in the Middle East - which is not usually the most optimistic of locations…so let’s investigate further.

![Step1](https://cmtoomey.github.io/img/firstmap-1434655660-9.gif)

#### **How to animate the map**

+ Convert the Date to a Date Parameter and then set a Calculated Field where [Parameter]=Date. You can cycle it with the handly plugin below.
+ Download and link to [jQuery Timer](https://github.com/jchavannes/jquery-timer).

Now, in your HTML insert this into the ```<head></head>``` section of the document:

    <script src=“/jquery.timer.js”></script>

Then you need to tweak your JS file (or ```<script>``` in HTML) to look something like this:

    var placeholderDiv = document.getElementById("tabmap");
    var url = "http://my-server/views/my-workbook/my-view";
    var options = {
     hideTabs: true,
     width: "INSERT YOUR WIDTH HERE",
     height: "INSERT YOUR HEIGHT HERE",
     onFirstInteractive: function() {
       // The viz is now ready and can be safely used.
       workbook = viz.getWorkbook();
       var i = 2;
       //278 is how many dates I have, you can swap it for any #
       var timer = $.timer(function() {
         if (i < 278) {
           workbook.changeParameterValueAsync("Time", i);
           i = i + 1;
         } else {
           i = 1;
         }
       });

       timer.set({
       time: 2000,
       autostart: true
     });
     //for pausing during app interaction
     $("#tabmap").mouseenter(function() {
       timer.pause();
     })
     //for resuming after app interaction
     $("#tabmap").mouseleave(function() {
       timer.play();
     })
   }

In order to keep the timer from continuing as you interact with the app, simply add timer.pause() to all the tab clicks, except explorer, where you use timer.play(). Things will pause and resume right where they left off - which means we can do faster analysis and not worry about Tableau lagging out.

We’ve got 14,000 people in our system, we need to narrow that down. Now click over to **METRICS**. Here’s we can filter individuals by minimum number of mentions, minimum number of countries talking about them, and minimum number of sources. Let’s adjust the minimums to 10% of each sliders’ total and see what happens.

![Metrics](https://cmtoomey.github.io/img/metrics-1434655778-59.png)

Now we are down to 45 people total. We can adjust out metrics by total and percent of total for each of the three counts. **Mentions** and **Geo-Mentions** are on a 0-1 scale, while **Citations** are multiplied by their Average Tone - higher emotion means more impact. Total Impact is just the product of all three (basically the Hot or Not scale). Let’s jump to Total Impact and sort the positive ones.

![First](https://cmtoomey.github.io/img/first-1434655933-71.png)

You’ll notice the Source Weight - I’m a nerd, so I’d rather only keep those with more Journal citations than Web sources (since I can’t know whether or not the Huffington Post or Buzzfeed-type sites are bumping up counts by cross-posting).  Let’s set it at halfway (+50) and re-sort.

![Second](https://cmtoomey.github.io/img/second-1434655942-83.png)

Looks like same people, just lower scores. Those Journal articles aren’t causing too much impact, but let’s stick with it. We’ve only got three or so people, down from 14,000, so Lasso them and let’s move on.

Click over to **THEMES**. Here we get a distribution of both topics and individual themes, as well as their popularity over time. It’s a 2-Sigma Bollinger band (meaning if the discussion gets so hot or cold that it’s passes the 2-Standard Deviation threshold, it will get flagged). We can adjust that threshold by changing how far it looks back - default is a One-Hour moving Average, let’s change that to 6.

![Themes](https://cmtoomey.github.io/img/screenshot-1434656192-29.png)

And there are the hot spots all together. Let’s lasso them and see what the top positive topics are.

It looks like the most positive category “General” - and within that category is something interesting. We scroll and we see **“Negotiations”** and **“Sanctions”** pop up - perhaps there was some good press in the Middle East for once?

![Themes1](https://cmtoomey.github.io/img/themes-1434656298-0.gif)

We’ll know as soon as we discover who was being talked about. Snag those two and let’s finish this.

![Finish](https://cmtoomey.github.io/img/screenshot-1434657952-61.png)

Ta-Da! John Kerry, Barack Obama, Hilary Clinton, and Mohammad Javad Zarif. Those are (or in Hilary’s case, were) the primary actors in the Iranian nuclear negotiations. What we just found, from a completely blind start, were positive signals of a final round of negotiations to secure a peaceful arrangement to control Iran’s nuclear program [(In the news here!)](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/31/world/europe/talks-begin-to-conclude-nuclear-deal-with-iran.html?ref=topics&_r=0).

The world talks about a lot of things, and its easy to zero in on the worst of the worst. Normally the good would get drowned out in a sea of nastiness (driven especially by the internet). Instead (and contrary to popular opinion), we found a glimmer of hope in a place that hasn’t had much since the 1970s and that has been a persistent global issue since the 1990s. That’s a very good thing. Nice work! Welcome to the world of intelligence analysis.

Now - start over, and see what interesting people, places, and things you can discover!
